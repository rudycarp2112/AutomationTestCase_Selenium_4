# FW is an organized way of maintain automation files. In the FW all the files will communicate each other to perform certain task.
# Goal:
# - Reusability
# - Maintainability
# types:
# 1- Buil-in: pytest, robotFrameWork, unittest, etc
# 2- Customized/user defined FW: DataDriven FW, Keyword FW, Hybrid driven FW
#
# Selenium Hybrid FW: Python, Selenium, PyTest, POM, HTML Reports.

# Phases before implement a FW:
# 1) analyze APP, technology & skill set of team, choose the TC but ¿How i choose the TC?
# Suppose we have 100 TC's, we will have two types of TC for automatized:
# - Re-TC (TDD)
# - Re-gression TC -> Test functionality that may be affected by a new feature o change
# - TC that can be automatizable
# ¿What it is 100%? Is automatized that TC can be automatized or if we are in condition to automatized all TC, this is impossible because we need much effort to make it.
#
# [Personal Thought] I think the TC that i need automatize are wich whom cover important scope of an funcionality of system most used.

# Automate those test cases that cover the most important functions of each type of user of the system that are critical (main modules)
# and leave aside the support functionalities (or at least dedicate few automatized TC). Regarding the main modules, I need to automate those scenarios that users use the most
# to carry out their daily work. In this way, you would automate the test cases.

# The FW works with Backend of the APP.

# 2) Design and implementation the FW:
# 3) Execution
# 4) Maintain TC (version control system)

-------------------- Install FW

1) Install packages we required:
    a) Selenium: Selenium libraries (OK)
    b) Pytest: Python UnitTest FW (OK)
    c) pytest-html: PyTest HTML reports
    d) pytest-xdist: Run test Parallel
    e) Openpyxl: MS Excel Support (OK)
    f) Allure-pytest: To generate alluere reports

2) Create a Folder Structure:
    a) pageObjects (package)
    b) testCases (package)
    c) utilities (package)
    d) Reports (folder)
    e) logs (folder)
    f) TestData (folder)
    g) Configurations (folder)
    h) Screenshots (folder)

3) Automating Login TC:
    a) Create LoginPage Object Class under "PageObjects"
    b) Create LoginTest under "TestCases"
    c) Create conftest.py under "TestCases"

4) Capture screnshot of failures
    a) Update loginTestCase winth screenshot under "TestCase"

    ---> (up to here it was reached in the first class)

5) Read common values from ini files (instead of have disperse all type of common variables as URL from TC we can create an ini file which we can call those variables) type of config file
    This is not for Test Data.
    a) Add "config.ini" file in configurations folder
    b) Create "readProperties.py" utility file under utilities package to read common data
    c) Replace hard coded values in Login Test Case. This manner we can a dynamic TC.

     If tomorrow day we want code more TC, its recommend go to the config.ini file and add
     all the variables we needed for each TC. And, of course, create a method who read those
     values in the readProperties file.

6) Adding logs to the TC
    a) Add customerLogger.py under utilities package
    b) Add logs to Login TC

    [Execution stage]
7) Run test cases of desired browser/Cross Browser /Parallel Browser
    a) Update constest.py with required fixtures wich will accept command line argument (browser name)
    b) Pass browser name as argument in command line (use "pytest_addoption" in conftest file)

     To Run TC in desired browser: pytest -v NopCommerceApp_Hybrid_FW/testCases/test_login.py --browser chrome (Done)
     To Run parallel TC: pytest -v -n=2 NopCommerceApp_Hybrid_FW/testCases/test_login.py --browser chrome (Done)

8) Generate pytest HTML Reports (pytest-html)
    a) Update "Confest.py" with pytest hooks
    b) To Generate html report run below command:
        pytest -v -n=2 --html=Reports\report.html testCases/test_login.py --browser chrome (we dont use "-s" option in pytest because is deprecated and cause some problems in report file)

9) Automating Data Driven TC
    a) Prepare test data in Excel Sheet, place the excel file inside the TestData folder
    b) Create "ExcelUtils.py" utility class under utilities packages
    c) Create loginDataDrivenTest under Test Case
    d) Run the TC

    ---> (up to here it was reached in the second class)

10) Add new automatized TC (This is commonly what the companies assign you --> read documents --> understand FW --> programming TC)
    a) Add a new customer
    b) Search customer by email
    c) Search customer by name

   [At this point we have completed design and implementation of the FW]
   ---> (up to here it was reached in the third class)

    [Now we move on to the maintenance stage]

11) Grouping TC
   a) Grouping markers (Add markers to every test method)
        @pytest.mark.sanity
        @pytest.mark.regression
   b) Add marker entries in pytest.ini file
        pytest.ini
        ------
        [pytest]
        markers =
            sanity
            regression
   c) select groups at run time
        pytest -v -m "sanity" --html=Reports/report.html testCases/ --browser chrome
        pytest -v -m "sanity and regression" --html=Reports/report.html testCases/ --browser chrome
        pytest -v -m "sanity or regression" --html=Reports/report.html testCases/ --browser chrome

    Instead of write this command every time we can create an executable file (.bat file)

    ATTENTION:before try the next step its important to install python, pip, and all libraries used in each TC (selenium, openpyxl, pytest and pytest-html throw PIP command).
    First, verify throw CMD that all of this libraries are installed (For that: click on CTRL+R and search "CMD".)
    .Example sentences: "python -V" and "pip list". If one of this commands launch an error similarly to this:
    '"python" not recognized as a internal or external command' then:
        step 1: go to windows configurations and open the window about environment variables for both users variables and system variables.
    Then add to each variable named "PATH" the dir location of python.exe that you installed and the directory location path named "scripts" where its found all pip .exe

        step 2: you need verify if all this libraries are install in the pyhton version that you installed. example sentences: "python -V", "pip list". Is these appears then good for you.
    On the contrary, go to install it one for one with pip commands. example: "pip install openpyxl"

    Second, try the next step now.

12) Run TC in command prompt and run.bat file
   a) Create run.bat file
   b) Open prompt as administrator and then run "run.bat" file

    Jenkins: is a Continuous Integration tool
    Git: is a tool
    GitHub: is the service to use Git (cloud environment)

    ---------------- This is the job is perform every day when we need develop a new version of SW--------------
    Local PC: we have GIT and Our CODE
                                         |
                                         \/
    Remote/Global: we have a REPOSITORY with Our CODE (automation TC) this is possible with GITHUB.
                                        ^
                                        |
    Jenkins: Will get the code from GITHUB repository and run some TC.
    ---------------- This is the job is perform every day when we need develop a new version of SW--------------

13) Push the code to Git and GitHub Repository
   First Round)
    Initial Steps (only one time)
    1) git ini --> Create an Local Empty git repository (Local repository) path of proyect: C:\Users\RudyX\PycharmProjects\TestingProyect_begin\NopCommerceApp_Hybrid_FW
            a) Open Git command prompt in that location
            b) git ini
            c) connect to the repository in github. Extract the URL from repository.
            d) git remote add origin "[URL repository]"
    2) git remote add origin "[URL]"  ------> connect my local git repository with GitHub

    Before doing commit first time we need to execute this belows commnads:
        git config --global user.name "[Username GitHub account]"
        git config --global user.email "[email GitHub account]"

     # Perform COMMIT in git repo
    3) git status --> show all the folder uncommited (red color)
    4) git add -A --> add all the files in to stagin/indexing area (before to perfom commit)
    5) git status --> show all the folder uncommited in staging area (green color)
    6) git commit -m "first commit"
    7) git status --> show nothing for commit
    8) git push -u origin master --> push the code from git

   Second Round)
    git status
    git add -A --> add all the files to staging/indexing area
    git commit -m "comment"
    git push -u origin master

    git pull ---> pull all the files from github to local (up to here

   [Finish the maintain of automation TC] (up to here it was reached in the fourth class)

   14) Run Test using jenkins (throw GitHub URL)
    Name of item jenkins: nopcommerce_github_seleniumPython
    Give the git.exe path to the devops team so they can configure Jenkins. example: "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\git.exe"

    Configuration of build in jenkins:
    GitHub Repository: https://github.com/rudycarp2112/AutomationTestCase_Selenium_4.git/
    Branch Name: */main
    Commands or steps i write to execute in "windows batch environment":
     - cd NopCommerceApp_Hybrid_FW
     - run.bat

    [Up to here the final fifth class] (Where i saw how to run the automatized TC with jenkins)
